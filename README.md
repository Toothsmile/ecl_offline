## Building EKF

### Prerequisites:

  * Matrix: A lightweight, BSD-licensed matrix math library: https://github.com/px4/matrix - it is automatically included as submodule.


By following the steps mentioned below you can create a shared library which can be included in projects using `-l` flag of gcc:

```
mkdir Build/
cd Build/
cmake ../EKF
make
```

Alternatively, just run:

```
./build.sh
```
